# Student Performance Predictions

I used Machine Learning to make a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib to predict student performance in secondary school (high school).

# Student Grade Predictions

## Goal
1. The goal is to use machine learning to predict a student�s final grade (G3).
2. Predict the final grade for each student for the school year.

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data integration, feature modelling and outcome prediction.

## Data

I used two datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance# - student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools, it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires, the dataset was modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.

## Environment and tools
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Scikit-learn
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib

I choose linear regression and got an accuracy of 88.2% on the test set. 

### From this model the highest grade is 18 and the lowest 0.
