# Student Performance Predictions

I used Machine Learning to make a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib to predict student performance in secondary school (high school).

# Student Grade Predictions

## Goal
1. The goal is to use machine learning to predict a studentï¿½s final grade (G3).
2. Predict the final grade for each student for the school year.

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data integration, feature modelling and outcome prediction.

## Data

I used two datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance# - student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools.

The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features, it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires, the dataset was modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.

## Environment and tools
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Scikit-learn
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib

I choose linear regression and got an accuracy of 88.2% on the test set. 

### From this model the highest grade achieved is '18' and the lowest grade achieved is '0' out of '20'.
